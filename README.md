# credit-risk-classification
Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the risk level of loans, classifying them as either healthy (label 0) or high-risk (label 1). Using logistic regression, the goal was to create a reliable and interpretable model that financial institutions can leverage to identify and manage risky loans effectively. By analyzing features such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, and debt-to-income ratio, the model aims to assist in minimizing financial risks while maintaining a robust decision-making framework for lending practices.

Results
Accuracy Score: 99%
The model correctly classified 99% of the loans in the dataset.
Precision Score:
Healthy loans (0): 100%
High-risk loans (1): 87%
Recall Score:
Healthy loans (0): 100%
High-risk loans (1): 94%
Summary
The logistic regression model performed exceptionally well, achieving an accuracy of 99%, with near-perfect classification for healthy loans and strong precision and recall for high-risk loans. This indicates that the model is highly effective in minimizing false negatives (misclassifying high-risk loans as healthy), which is critical for managing financial risks. Given its strong performance metrics and ability to handle the classification task effectively, this model is highly recommended for use by the company. It provides a reliable and efficient tool for identifying risky loans, allowing the institution to make data-driven decisions to mitigate financial losses.
