# credit-risk-classification
The project involved analyzing a lending dataset to classify loans as either healthy (label 0) or high-risk (label 1) using a logistic regression model. The dataset included features such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of credit accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt, with the loan status as the target variable. After loading the data into a Pandas DataFrame, it was split into features (X) and labels (y). The train_test_split method was used to divide the data into training and testing sets to ensure the model could be trained and evaluated effectively.

A logistic regression model was then created and trained using the training data. After fitting the model, predictions were made on the testing data. The model's performance was evaluated using a confusion matrix and a classification report, which revealed an impressive overall accuracy of 99%. The model demonstrated near-perfect precision and recall for predicting healthy loans, while also effectively identifying high-risk loans with a precision of 87% and recall of 94%. This makes the model a valuable tool for financial institutions to identify and manage risky loans, ensuring robust decision-making processes in lending operations.
